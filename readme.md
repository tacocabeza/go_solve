### go_solve

cli tool that will solve mazes!

pass in a maze (a .png file) and go_solve will solve the maze and output solution (another .png) file highlighting the solution it found.

### usage

```
./go_solve <path_to_your_maze>.png
```

Some assumptions:

- wall thickness and space sizing are 1x1
- there is maze entrance and exit
- mazes I used were generated here: https://keesiemeijer.github.io/maze-generator/#generate
